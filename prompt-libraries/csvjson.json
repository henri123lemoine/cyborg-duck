It’s a classic,\" he said with a smile.\n\"I’m trying to broaden my horizons,\" Wayne said, returning the smile. \"Science has always fascinated me, but I never had the opportunity to study it in depth.\"\n\"Well, I’m always happy to chat about science with a fellow enthusiast,\" Einstein said, returning the book to Wayne. \"Perhaps we could continue this conversation over a cup of coffee?\"\nWayne nodded eagerly. \"I know just the place.\"\nAs they settled in at a nearby café, Wayne brought up a point that he had read in the book they had been discussing.\n\"I found this argument to be particularly interesting,\" Wayne said, pointing to a paragraph in the book. \"But I’m not sure if it’s scientifically valid.
